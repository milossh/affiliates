              Firefox Affiliate buttons are a bit of html
              code that you put on your website or blog to encourage
              visitors to your site to download Firefox. When a visitor
              to your site clicks on a button on your site and visits the
              Firefox download page, you get credit for that click.

              Affiliates who get a lot of clicks through their site
              will be featured on our leaderboard and be elegible for
              fun stuff like Firefox T-shirts. While we do send out
              prizes and gifts to our affiliates from time to time,
              Firefox Affiliates does not offer monetary rewards for
              hosting Firefox buttons.

            It's easy! Start at the button picker, select the Firefox
            product or campaign that you'd like to support, pick your
            button style, shape and color, then copy and paste the
            code into the html of your site. Your unique affiliate ID
            will be in that code, so that you get credit for every
            click you send our way.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            {% trans %}

            This is also easy. Simply delete the code. If you want to
            put it back in again, just copy and paste it from the
            button picker.

            Sometimes we run special time-limited campaigns to
            encourage people to download Firefox. If you're using an
            affiliate button for one of these campaigns, try to update
            your button as soon as you can. People who click on that
            button will be directed to a general Firefox download
            page. You'll get credit for the click as an affiliate,
            but you may not get credit for clicks for that specific
            campaign.
