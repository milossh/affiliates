{{ _('Using Affiliate banners') }}

{{ _('What is Firefox Affiliates?') }}
{{ _('Firefox Affiliates allows you to build banners and place them on your Facebook profile to encourage visitors to download Firefox. When a visitor to your page or status update clicks on a banner and visits the Firefox download page, you get credit for that click. Affiliates who get a lot of clicks through their profile will be featured on our leaderboard and be elegible for fun stuff like Firefox T-shirts and, if you opt in, we may feature your banner in a paid-ad on the Facebook ad network. While we do send out prizes and gifts to our Affiliates from time to time, Firefox Affiliates does not offer monetary rewards for hosting Firefox banners.') }}

{{ _('How do I add a banner to my Facebook profile?') }}
{% trans link='#' %}
Select a banner design that you like using the <a href="{{ link }}">banner builder</a>, add a personal message about why you love Firefox and then click "share." This will post the banner to your Facebook timeline and into your friends' newsfeed. When you get activity on your banner, you'll get an update on your timeline.
{% endtrans %}

{{ _('How do I invite a friend to use Firefox?') }}
{{ _('If you\'d like to personally invite someone to use Firefox, just select "Share ad with friends" from the side menu and you will be able to send a Facebook message with a custom Firefox download link. If your friend clicks on the link, you\'ll also get credit for the click.') }}

{{ _('Can my banner become a paid Facebook ad?') }}
{% trans link='mailto:affiliates@mozilla.org', click_count=50 %}
Once you've reached {{ click_count }} clicks on a Facebook banner, your banner will become eligable to be a paid Facebook ad. This means that Mozilla will pay to have an ad placed on the Facebook ad network sharting your message of why you love Firefox. We will notify you if your banner is chosen to be a paid ad in your region. If you do not want to participate in this, don't click the opt-in when you build your banner. If you've opted in by accident, please contact us at <a href="{{ link }}">affiliates@mozilla.org</a> and we'll make sure you aren't included in the ad selection.
{% endtrans %}

{{ _('How do I remove the application?') }}
{% trans link='mailto:affiliates@mozilla.org' %}
